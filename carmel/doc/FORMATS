A weighted finite state transducer (WFST) is a directed graph with weighted
arcs, and an input and output label on each arc.  Each vertex is called a
"state", and one state is designated as the initial state and another as the
final state.  Every path from the initial state to the final state represents
a transduction from the concatenation of the input labels of arcs along the
path, to the concatenation of the output labels, with a weight equal to the
product of the weights of each transition taken.  The weight of a transduction
may represent, for instance, the conditional probability of the output
sequence given the input sequence.  The actual weight that should be assigned
to a transduction is, more accurately, the sum of the weights of all possible
paths which emit the input:output sequence, but it is more convenient to
search for the best path, so that the sum is approximated by the maximum.  A
special "empty" symbol, when used as an input or output label, disappears in
the concatenations.

Two transductions may be composed, meaning that the weight of any input:output
pair is the sum over all intermediate possibilities of the product of the
weight of input:intermediate in the first and the weight of
intermediate:output in the second.  If the transductions represent conditional
probabilities, and the intermediate possibilities represent a partition of
events such that input and output are independent given the intermediate
possibilities, then the conditional probability of output given input is given
by the composition of the first transducer, which contains the probabilities
p(input|intermediates) and the second transducer, which contains the
probabilities p(intermediates|output).  Given two WFST representing
transductions, another WFST representing the composition of the two
transductions can be easily created (with up to the product of the number of
states).

This program accepts parenthesized lists of states and arcs in a variety of
formats.  Whitespace can be used freely between symbols.  States are named by
any string of characters (except parentheses) delimited by whitespace, or
contained in bounding quotes or asterisks ("state 1" or *initial state*, for
example).  Input/output symbols are of the same format, except they must not
begin with a number, decimal point, or minus.  Input/output symbols bounded by
asterisks are intended to be special symbols.  Only one, *e*, the empty
symbol, is currently treated differently by the program.  Special symbols
are not case sensitive (converted to lowercase on input).  Quoted symbol names
may contain internal quotes so long as they are escaped by a backslash
immediately preceding them (e.g. "\"hello\"").  Symbols should not be longer
than 4000 characters.  Weights are floating point numbers, optionally followed
immediately by the letters 'log', in which case the number is the base 10
logarithm of the actual weight (logarithms are used internally to avoid
underflow).

Every transducer file begins with the name of the final state, and is followed
by a list of arcs.  No explicit list of states is needed; if a state name
occurs as the source or destination of an arc, it is created.  Each
parenthesized expression of the form describes zero or more arcs (here the
asterisk means zero or more repetitions of the parenthesized expression to the
left) :

(source-state (destination-state input output weight)*)
(source-state (destination-state (input output weight)*)*)

Reminder: except for input and output symbols starting with * or ", or
containing parentheses or spaces, quotes are not necessary.

If right parentheses following "weight" is immediately preceded by an
exclamation point ('!'), then that weight will be locked and unchanged by
normalization or training (however, the arc may still be eliminated by reduction
(absence of -d) or consolidation (-C) operations).  If that ! is followed by a
positive integer, all such arcs sharing the same integer id are constrained to
have the same weight in normalization (and thus, training).  Hint: -N 0 will
lock all the arcs, and -N 1 will number them sequentially starting at 1.
Intersecting with a locked weighted identity transducer can give a
multiplicative prior for training (as opposed to the normal additive Dirichlet
prior from -+).

The initial state is the source-state mentioned in the first such expression.
"weight" can be omitted, for a default weight of one.  "output" can also be
ommitted, in which case the output is the same as the input.  This program
outputs transducers using the first option, giving only one expression per
"source-state", and exhaustively listing every arc out of that state in no
particular order, omitting "weight" and "output" whenever they are not
needed.  However, inputs may even contain many of these expressions sharing
the same "source-state", in which case the arcs are added to the existing
state.

When the -n or -b options are used, the input is instead sequences of
space-separated symbols, from which a finite state automata accepting exactly
that sequence with weight one (a FSA is simply a transducer where very arc has
matching input and output, and a weight of one).  With the -b (batch) option,
the input may consist of any number of such sequences, each on their own
line.  Each input sequence must be no longer than 60000 characters.

When the -m option is specified, meaningful names will be assigned to states
created in the composition of two WFST, in the following format (otherwise
state names are numbers assigned sequentially):

lhs-WFST-state-name|filter-state|rhs-WFST-state-name

"filter-state" is a number between 0 and 2, representing the state in an
implicit intermediate transducer used to eliminate redundant paths using empty
(*e*) transitions.

When -k number-of-paths is used without limiting the output with -i or -o,
paths are displayed as a list of space-separated, parenthesized arcs:

(input-symbol : output-symbol / weight -> destination-state)

followed by the path weight (the product of the weights in the sequence) at
the end of the line.
