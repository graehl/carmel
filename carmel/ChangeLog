2008-02-05  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/carmel.cc (CARMEL_VERSION): v3.6 // -: = cache em
	derivations including reverse structure (uses more memory but
	faster iterations) // -? = cache em derivations; currently limited
	to memory; should change to use disk

2007-12-13  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/carmel.cc (usageHelp): -= 2.0 (raise all weights by power of 2)

2007-11-02  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/train.cc: print per-output-symbol ppx

2007-11-01  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/fst.cc (reduce): fixed segfault when a self-epsilon loop arc
	is eliminated by reduce (no -d), followed by conditional
	normalization (-n)

2007-09-10  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/wfstio.cc: % is the line-initial comment character (to agree
	with tutorial).  if you use # before, sorry

2007-07-24  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/train.cc (train_estimate): fixed training example multiplicity (was doubly scaled)

2007-07-16  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/carmel.cc (CARMEL_VERSION): 3.3

2007-07-12  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/carmel.cc: -+ 0: mean-field with alpha=0 (normalization: exp(digamma(alpha+w_i))/exp(digamma(alpha+sum w_j))

2007-06-20  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* fixed bugs (thanks, valgrind) all over: reading transducers with
	locked arcs, -a (tied arc preserving, for training) composition,
	-m (meaningful state names). decipherment (-a composition followed
	by training) works again.

2005-07-08  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/wfstio.cc: I changed nothing about the output of transducers
	(keeping the new e^ default instead of "ln"), but carmel now can
	properly identify e^-n weights in the presence of omitted input or
	output symbols.  Also, the following formats are now accepted:

(source dest weight)  (epsilon i/o)
(source dest input weight) (fsa)
(source dest input output weight) (fst)

and also variants like:

(source (dest weight) (dest input weight) (dest weight) (dest () (weight) (input weight)))

although I'm not sure what the use is of such flexibility ;)


2005-07-06  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/wfstio.cc: revamped wfst-reading code to handle ambiguity in
	optional input/output symbol and weights in e^-1.3 form.  also
	show error context when bad input is detected.

2005-03-29  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/carmel.cc: 

2004-09-23  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* ../shared/ChangeLog SEE ALSO (split source files into
	carmel-specific vs. general)
	
2004-08-27  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/fst.cc: changed kbest interface to visitor vs. returning
	list of paths; included wfstio.cc and compose.cc since they'll
	never be used without fst.cc (and to reduce the number of
	compilation units due to a GNU Make bug with long eval lines

	* Makefile: merged build system for tree transducer and Carmel
	toolkits (../shared/graehl.mk)

2004-07-16  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/dynarray.h: nonstd namespace for reimp of stuff that used to
	be std (construct, uninitialized_copy)

2004-07-15  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/list.h: two-phase name lookup gcc 3.4 problems also
	everywhere, see C++ spec section 14.6.2 paragraph 3 and section
	14.6.2.1. or
	http://groups.google.com/groups?q=base+class+%22depend+on+a+template+parameter,+so%22&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=MY3kc.28415%24Qc.1096675%40twister1.libero.it&rnum=2

	> Replacing f() with A<T>::f() will fix it.

	Sure, as the name is now qualified and dependent on T, it will be bound 
	at the point of instantiation (phase two). In phase two, the compiler 
	knows the exact type that replaces T and so it can select the right 
	specialization of A<T> (specializing A<T> after this point makes the 
	program ill-formed).

	Another, more elegant, way to make the name dependent is by writing 
	this->f().

	
	* src/2hash.h: isn't compiling in gcc 3.4 because
	std::allocator::rebind isn't a template?

	* Makefile: now requires checkout of the tt project in parent dir
	(files should be in ../tt from here)

2004-04-21  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/strhash.h: tidied up templatization of Alphabet and added
	more tests

	* src/compose.cc: removed incorrect double-usage of static_itoa
	when naming composition of (unnamed) transducers, although that
	could never happen from the command line

2004-04-16  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/dynarray.h: optimization on push_back and end(): store vector 
	end instead of size.  removeMarked uses memmove on larger blocks.
	new Array class is base for DynamicArray.  unit test.

2004-02-27  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/2hash.h: made find_second, add global template functions,
	can use unordered_map (had to fix bugs in it though, and it takes
	36 bytes for an empty table compared to 24 for mine) if you
	#define UNORDERED_MAP in config.h.  My size goes down to 16 if you
	define STATIC_HASHER and STATIC_HASH_EQUAL

2004-02-12  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/finite.cc: finally hunted down problem with post-training
	estimate/normalize in debug mode - total sum is the same, but
	number of nonzero weight arcs is too low.  cause was eachParameter
	being called before normalization to check for NaN; tied groups
	get assigned to the value of whichever arc in that group is
	visited first (ok after normalization, but not before)

	* src/2hash.h: many changes (to all files) moving interface closer
	to proposed STL standard unordered_map - new insert returns
	whether key existed before as well as pointer to the new (or old)
	entry.  ultimately will require a proxy object to use STL hash
	(find_second)

2003-12-12  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/finite.cc: fixed NaN training/normalization problem in debug mode

2003-12-11  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/finite.cc: -! n = random training restarts

2003-11-20  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/finite.cc: -1 = randomly scale weights (of unlocked arcs)
	after composition uniformly by (0..1]

Wed Nov  5 15:46:03 2003  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@brahms.isi.edu>

	* src/fst.cc: normalization fix for zero-count tied arcs - count
 	their competititors against their group and set them to their
 	teammates' value

2003-10-16  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/wfstio.cc: fixed bug in one-arc per line output of
	zero-weight arcs (showed up with -t)

Mon Oct 13 15:40:05 2003  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@brahms.isi.edu>

	* src/train.cc: fixed scaling of relative log-likelihood convergence

2003-09-10  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/compose.cc: fixed bug when -i and -m used together (referencing state names array when -i doesn't name states)

2003-09-08  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/finite.cc: changed default to named-states and made -K
	option enable integer-states

Thu Aug 28 14:15:46 2003  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@brahms.isi.edu>

	* src/config.h (CONFIG_H): define DOUBLE_PRECISION to use doubles
 	instead of floats (probably 25% more memory would be used in a
 	transducer, and 70% more in training)

Wed Aug 27 17:12:16 2003  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@brahms.isi.edu>

	* src/train.cc: -o 1.1 scales EM changes, new code to deal with anomoly that EM can worsen perplexity if tied arcs make normalization unstable/nonconvergent (e.g. span.spell.wfst).  related changes in several files.

Tue May 20 17:14:36 2003  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@enescu.isi.edu>

	* marcu hide-the-transducer changes (if #define MARCU in finite.cc)

2003-03-28  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/wfstio.cc: added option (-K) to force state names, otherwise
	assume if finalstate is an integer, that states are unnamed
	(non-sparse integer indices)

	* src/strhash.h: fixed STRINGPOOL, added named_states flag
	(stateName not thread-safe if unnamed states)

2003-03-27  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/finite.cc: ownalphabet in compose chain - copies (rather
	than transfers) alphabet ... performance ...  unify code for -l
	and -r (loops have start, end, direction +1 or -1; or, reverse
	list and use same loop (but switch order of arguments if you do))
	-q = quiet (added some default logging)

2002-12-17  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/wfstio.cc: ignore/strip CR char (so unix carmel can process
	DOS-text output); added graphvis 8.5x11 landscape formatting

2002-12-16  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/wfstio.cc: implemented -Y (GraphViz)

	* src/2hash.h: moved static pool allocator stuff into #ifdef
	CUSTOMNEW and tested with/without it defined

	* src/finite.cc: added -Y option for output of GraphViz .dot files

2002-12-13  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	removed leftover node.h (old homegrown list) from CVS

	* src/slist.h: (and many other files) - when USE_SLIST defined in
	config.h, use a singly linked list (memory efficient) in all
	cases.  required some serious rework, but I was using a singly
	linked list until Yaser tore it out in favor of STL list.  my
	slist is largely STL compatible (not everything implemented) with
	the addition of two types of iterators - one that uses an extra
	level of indirection to allow insertion, and another that uses a
	plain pointer for more efficiently examining values

2002-12-10  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/wfstio.cc: allow zero-weight arcs on input - useful with -U prior counts

	* src/train.cc: changed trainBegin to take parameters for -f and
	-U.  new prior_counts attribute for each arc in training (Dirichlet prior)

	* src/finite.cc: added -U option: initial weights as prior counts for training

2002-11-22  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/graph.cc: changed mind.  split into two functions - one that
	builds all-source->one dest tree, other does single-source
	dijikstra and sets taken link pointers

	* src/kbest.cc: changed mind.  moved kbest reverse code into
	graph.cc function

	* src/finite.cc: added command line description of -w, -z

	* src/fst.h: added clear() and printArc()
	
	* src/config.h: added Config::debug() warn() and log() stream
	fetchers.  new DEBUG options

	* src/fst.cc: added prunePaths code.  tested.  changed reduce,
	removing yaser's set-tie-group-to-zero for deleted arcs.  should
	have no effect.

	* src/kbest.cc: because of change in graph.cc, reverse graph
	before bestPathsTree.

	* src/graph.cc: changed bestPathsTree to do single-source all-dest
	instead of single-dest.  

	* src/finite.cc: added -w,-z max-state/path-cost-ratio pruning
	options, restructured prune/minimize code (do not prune before
	training/assigning weights)

2002-11-21  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/weight.h: added pow, root, {set|Is}Infinity

	* src/fst.h: added WFST::log, warn, debug output streams

	* src/finite.cc: added -X option to set perplexity convergence ratio.  bumped version.

	* src/graph.cc: reworked topological sort to detect cycles.  put state and code in TopoSort class.

	* src/train.cc: changed perplexity measurement to per-symbol.  added ppx ratio convergence option


2002-11-07  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* src/train.cc: added perplexity measurement to training (-t)

	* Makefile: changes ARCH to linux/solaris/cygwin/freebsd, set CC.$ARCH to point to gcc version 3

	* src/weight.h: default output base is now e (and output is -30ln instead of -10log)

	* src/wfstio.cc: lines beginning with # (that aren't part of a quoted symbol) are ignored as comments

	* src/finite.cc: state names are no longer removed and replaced with numbers by default except in composition;
	this should help people who are only using carmel for -k best paths and don't understand why their state numbers change

	new options:
	-g no longer bounds number of arcs taken between min and min+#states, nor requires normalization.
	-G randomly chooses arcs according to joint normalization and lists them like -k
	-u blocks normalization entirely during e.g. training; can be used with -tuM 1 to give forward-backward counts for arcs
	-j performs joint rather than conditional normalization
	-B, -Z, -D options for output format of weights, -H,-J transducer output options:
	may make reading carmel output more palatable to programs
